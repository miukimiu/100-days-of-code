# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 5, 2016

**Today's Progress**: Created repository spotify-hiphop-ionic. An ionic app just to play with the Spotify API.

**Thoughts:** It was easy to create the app and to call the spotify API because I've done it before.

**Today's Progress**: Duplicate an array.
<!--
**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality. -->

**Today's Progress**: Progress on spotify-hiphop-ionic. Created a pipe for sort by followers.
